# Azure-Based Active Directory Deployment and Access Management Lab

This lab demonstrates the setup of a basic Active Directory environment using Windows Server and a domain-joined client. It includes user creation, Group Policy configuration, and troubleshooting access issues, simulating an internal business network.

---

## üìã Lab Overview

- Windows Server 2022 as Domain Controller (DC)  
- Windows 10/11 VM as domain client  
- Tasks performed:  
  - Installed Active Directory and DNS roles on DC  
  - Created domain users, organizational units (OUs), and groups  
  - Applied Group Policies (wallpaper enforcement, Task Manager restriction, etc.)  
  - Shared files and managed permissions  
  - Troubleshot login and remote access errors

> Logged in with domain user accounts to verify that Group Policies and permissions were correctly applied, such as enforced wallpaper and disabled Task Manager.

### RDP Access Troubleshooting  
![Access Denied - RDP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39aedec-02db-4b9b-b297-7d42454df0a8)  
> Encountered an error preventing domain users from remotely accessing the client VM via RDP. Resolved by accessing the Domain Controller, modifying the client VM‚Äôs system properties, and explicitly granting RDP permissions to the domain users group.

## üß† Lessons Learned

- Interaction and precedence of NTFS and share permissions  
- Importance of correct DNS configuration for domain authentication  
- Configuring ‚ÄúAllow log on locally‚Äù rights for users  
- Managing RDP access via system properties when Group Policy settings alone are insufficient
